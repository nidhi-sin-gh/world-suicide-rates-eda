Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in the data science process. It involves the use of statistical and visualization techniques to gain insights into the data and uncover hidden patterns and relationships. In this notebook, we will be exploring the EDA of suicide rates from the year 1985 to 2015. Suicide is a serious public health issue that affects millions of people worldwide. By analyzing the data, we hope to gain a better understanding of the trends, factors, and patterns associated with suicide rates, and to develop effective preventive measures. This tutorial will cover topics such as suicide trends, geographical analysis, and social and economic factors that may contribute to suicide. We will also discuss potential areas for future research to continue to learn and improve our understanding of this important topic.
